Search for Operators that act as Clifford's in Pauli Subspaces

Based on work in [link](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.030502).

Using a QuantumGate class this construct a universal pool from H, CNOT, T gates with max depth proportional to approximation error (solovay-kitaev) and checks if these operators behave as Clifford gates in this space.

If interesting examples can be found these may be able to be used for efficent scrambling simulations.
